<h1 align="Center">IjeryMeteo Weather App</h1>
<p>This is a Web App that allows you to know the weather by getting your location. It also allows visitors to search for cities and get the weather accordingly.</p>
See it <a href="https://ijerymeteo.netlify.app">here</a> 
<h3>How is it made?</h3>
I implemented <a href="https://ijerymeteo. netlify. app" >IjeryMétéo </a>using React and TailwindCSS for the frontend and making API calls to fetch the data.
<h3>API mainly used</h3>
-**Open-meteo**: For getting weather forecasts. <br/>
-**Geogeonames**: For search suggestions.

<h3>Want to test localy?</h3>

Just hit '**npm install**' to install the dependancies and '**npm run dev**' to run the development server.

**Let me know if you want to collaborate :)!**
